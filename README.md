ballistic projectiles. 

The approach and model are detailed in:

## Installation and usage

The model is located in the *simulator/* folder and the post-processing functions in the *post-processing/* folder. Note that you **do not necessarily need** to compile the model, you can simply use the simulator/GBF_FULL*.jar file.

Instructions are provided in the [included documentation](https://github.com/unigeSPC/gbf/raw/master/doc/doc.pdf). Additional instructions on the post-processing of VBP data are also provided in [this blog post](https://e5k.github.io/codes/2017/10/09/ballistic-post-processing/)

## Releases
**Apr 2018**: Changes in the definition of the source and new post-processing functions
**Nov 2016**: First release
